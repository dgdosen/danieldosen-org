OK, now this is geeky, but I needed to share it.  Take you iPad and add a VNC client (I added Remoter, which is 99 cents of bugginess).  Use your iPad with a BT keyboard, connect the VNC client to your Mac Lion machine - or  VM (even over a 3G connection), start up iTerm on the host and VIM away...

I wanted to see how snappy this would be using an iPad over Personal Hotspot sharing on my iPhone... and it's kind of nice!  Now I need a stand for the iPad.  

I also need to stay within VIM or iTerm2 when doing git checkins..
