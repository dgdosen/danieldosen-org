    <div class="entrybody">
      <p>I watched the latest and very helpful Railscast episode this morning - on <a href='http://railscasts.com/episodes/285-spork'>Spork</a> and wound up tweaking all the projects I&#8217;m working on to incorporate some of the things I learned in that screencast.</p>

<p>I also wound up tweaking a checklist I maintain in an Evernote entry of what I do to setup a Rails project. Of the projects I&#8217;m working on, I wind up putting them all into a similar environment and figured it would be a useful blog post. So here it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a git repository: Git is pretty awesome. If you don&#8217;t care who sees your app, you can stick it up on Github for free! This is a no brainer. - <a href='http://github.com'>Github</a>: Cheap and easy for a team of developers - Roll your own: I have a <a href='http://linode.com'>Linode</a> slice, and put up a private git repository</li>

<li>Create a generic .gitignore file for the app. Here&#8217;s what I start with (on MacOS): - .bundle - db/*.sqlite3 - log/*.log - tmp/restart.txt - tmp/* - .DS_Store - public/system/documents* - .sass-cache/* - .powenv # I use <a href='http://pow.cx/'>pow</a></li>

<li>Use RVM: <a href='http://beginrescueend.com'>RVM</a> helps you manage multiple version of Rubies and related gem environments. I try to use one rvm for all my &#8220;rails 3.1 apps that could end up on heroku&#8221; and call it <code>rails31</code> - Add a .rvmrc file to the root directory: You should do this before you run <code>rails new</code> because you want to make sure you&#8217;re using the version of ruby rails you want. This means you should have a ruby and gemset created already via rvm.</li>

<li>Create the app: <code>rails new &lt;app_name&gt;</code> (I create so few apps, I always have to look this up - although now that I just wrote it in a blog entry, I&#8217;ll probably never have to do it again.)</li>

<li>Add the gems you want to work with. I&#8217;ve always add a few to support BDD/TDD. - pg: Postgres is the default database on heroku, where most of my apps end up. On top of that, I like the pg admin tool on mac os. Much more pleasant that mysql or using sqlite. - metric_fu: Based on advice from the Railscast <a href='http://railscasts.com/episodes/252-metrics-metrics-metrics'>Metrics, Metrics, Metrics</a>. Simplecov is great. - formtastic: great for form processing - rspec-rails: I like RSpec over TestUnit - cucumber-rails: I also like BDD - even though it can be expensive in terms of time to run a test suite. - capybara - nokogiri: helpful with cucumber and capybara - factory_girl_rails: test factories</li>

<li>Add gems for continous testing: Rails 3.1 takes a few seconds to load - and I&#8217;d rather adopt tools that make it easy to re-run tests without delays: - database-cleaner: help with speeding up test runs - spork: a distributed ruby server environment - guard: supports continuous testing - guard-spork: helps to configure guard and spork - guard-rspec: helps to configure guard and rspec (don&#8217;t forget the cli options :all_on_start =&gt; false) - guard-cucumber: helps to configure guard and cucumber rb-fsevent - a listener for guard</li>

<li>Did you Check in yet? Check in early and often</li>

<li>Change your spec_helper.rb file and move functionality up into the Spork pre fork block.</li>

<li>Change your environment.rb to allow for factory girl and cucumber integration (of lots of borrowable step definitions)</li>

    <div class="entrybody">
      <p>I just wrapped up a project (well, the first phase of a project) using <a href='http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3'>Microsoft&#8217;s MVC3</a> framework for a client here in Seattle. Similar to other clients I&#8217;ve worked with, they&#8217;re a Microsoft shop and have an existing investment in the MS stack for building applications. They wanted to leverage that investment on this project.</p>

<p>Working with MVC3 was pretty cool in that I had a different perspective of using Rails(Ruby) and Django/AppEngine(Python). So, now I have perspective on using MS MVC3 I figure I&#8217;d share it with you. Feel free to comment.</p>

<p>First - some things I liked about using MS MVC3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Intellisense - If you&#8217;re going to use MS technology, you need to use those tools, and Visual Studio is great in its implementation of Intellisense. It makes it easy to code and build your app. There&#8217;s even Intellisense in Razor - the MS MVC equivalent to erb.</li>

<li>Visual Studio Debugging - Another great way to leverage the tools to step in, add watches, and examine what&#8217;s going on in your app while the server is doing its thing.</li>

<li>The Entity Framework - I&#8217;ll admit, I used to work on that team, so I&#8217;m impartial (Don&#8217;t worry, everything I worked on is well hidden). I like EF and where it&#8217;s going. If you&#8217;re staring with a DB from scratch, the EF has some nice tools integrated within Visual Studio that makes it easy to get up and running.</li>

<li>Nugets: They&#8217;re the VS way to manage things like Gems inside a project. There&#8217;s really no equivalent to RVM/VirtualEnv as it just makes sure everything is up to date - but the Nuget management made it easy to add functionality form the MVC3/.Net ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things I didn&#8217;t like about MVC3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Migrations. Wow - I&#8217;m spoiled by Rails Migrations. They are essential when working with a team of developers. They help make it blood simple to let any one developer catch up with database changes on their own terms. I can&#8217;t remember how I lived without them. Even Objective C on iOS has their Core Data Migration capabilities. MVC3 does not. That&#8217;s painful.</li>

<li>ViewModelClasses. That&#8217;s right, Models, just for the views. You already define your models, but say you want to pass a few things to a view, you should create a ViewModel Class to create strong typing of that data when you get painting those views. Sure it makes you think about what your sending to the view, but it just feels unproductive to me. With rails, you just create an @instance variable and you&#8217;re ready to go. Much simpler, IMO.</li>

<li>Crashes. Visual Studio crashes alot (this is on a mid2010 MacBookPro.) Bootcamp and Windows7 run great, but Visual Studio just crashes from time to time. It&#8217;s a very heavyweight stack. Compare that to VIM, which I use for everything these days, and it&#8217;s a letdown. It&#8217;s the price you pay for that Intellisense. I&#8217;ll chose the VIM plugins any day.</li>

<li>The ecosystem. Between Github and Stackoverflow, I can overcome any issue I have with a Rails app, usually in a manner of seconds. The wealth of information at your fingertips is awesome. The community works. With MVC3, there&#8217;s MSDN forums, but I found myself using Stackoverflow more often that not, and when I did, it was a bit of an echo chamber. The ability to execute within the open world of Rails just seems to move at a faster pace to me. For example, Rails just implemented CoffeeScript. With MVC3, you can, but it took some hunting, and there&#8217;s only a couple of Google links that get you to the Web Workbench tools. Or Testing. Sure there&#8217;s NUnit and Microsoft Test, but I kind of like RSpec&#8217;s matching language, and all the BDD/TDD goodness you can get from using RSpec and Cucumber together. It just seems like tools can get introduced, get developed and mature faster in the open source world.</li>
</ul>

<p>On that last point, I was talking about this with my client today. The &#8220;open&#8221; world is just getting faster and better and I don&#8217;t see how MS can keep pace unless they change the way they do things. Add to that the cost savings (bring your best TCO argument) of the non-MS environment, and I know what I&#8217;d choose, I&#8217;m just happy their&#8217;s a choice.</p>

    <div class="entrybody">
      <p>OK, now this is geeky, but I needed to share it. Take your iPad and add a VNC client (I added Remoter, which is 99 cents of bugginess). Now use your iPad with a BT keyboard and connect the VNC client to a Mac Lion machine - or VM. Start up iTerm on the host and VIM away&#8230;</p>

<p><img src='/images/vnc-vim.png' alt='Vim over VNC' /></p>

<p>This image may look a little ugly, but Remoter doesn&#8217;t seem to hang on to my keyboard unless I have the onscreen keyboard up. Luckily, you can just alpha it away&#8230;</p>

<p>I wanted to see how snappy this would be using an iPad over my iPhone Personal Hotspot sharing&#8230; and it&#8217;s kind of nice! Now I need a stand for the iPad.</p>

<p>I also need to stay within VIM or iTerm2 when doing git checkins. I haven&#8217;t really tried fugitive.vim, because gitx is so nice. I think I&#8217;ll have to give it a shot.</p>

    <div class="entrybody">
      <p>So, this is what I need - Well, this is what I wanted before I started out thinking I should build a Schedule gem:</p>
<img src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/maptini.com/app/public/system/images/34389/original/06f9e830-b375-012e-3f0a-12313d0361e4.png?1328034042' alt='Scheduling Gem' width='800' />
<p>The problem is, I really haven&#8217;t found any schedule gems that I like.</p>

<p>What I want, is to be able to create a schedule, in a manner very similar to the API shown on the ice_cube gem - but with more than just an API, as I want something that&#8217;s easy to show on a Rails (or Formtastic) form. So, why not build a new one&#8230; That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at right now. I&#8217;ll let you know where it goes.</p>
