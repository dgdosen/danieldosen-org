  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;ve been watching the news and the slow-moving-train wreck of the European Union, I sit here and wonder how and why smart people are doing dumb things with the world economy.  If and when the Euro does go down, imagine the costs of currency switching in all those EU countries.  Not only is that going to be a drain on each of those economies, it will also dampen an already weak world economy. This is going to hurt the US.  What&#8217;s worse is that the US economy is in such bad shape as it is, I&#8217;m not sure how much more it can take.</p>

<p>This is particularly bad new for Obama, as no matter what, this is his economy, and if things get worse, he&#8217;ll really be certain of a single term.</p>

<p>If there is any silver lining in all of this, we will be able to look back on how the EU painted themselves into a corner where some countries (Greece, Italy and Spain) couldn&#8217;t operate within the narrow financial constraints that the EU imposed on them.  If things do fall apart, I hope that painful lesson only has to be felt once.</p>

<p>At any rate - here&#8217;s some good reading on the crisis (IMO):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/11/euro-crisis-5">The Economist</a></li>
<li><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/this-mornings-grim-eurothought">Paul Krugman</a> has been talking about this potential breakup for a while, and it&#8217;s been really interesting to watch.  Just search for &#8216;euro&#8217; on his blog.</li>
</ul>


<p>The other sad point in all this (to me) is that politicians are more stubborn in the US, and while we don&#8217;t have the same kinds of issues as the EU, we&#8217;re still in a heavily under-performing economy. Our politicians (many of them) are certain that the only way out is less spending and more austerity.  It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s no lesson learned from the Depression or Japan of the 90&#8217;s&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, while I&#8217;m getting much better with vim, my only complaint as of a couple of days ago, was, IMO, my constant use of jklm/bw in normal mode. Specifically, when navigating around in a file, I found myself hitting too many  j&#8217;s and k&#8217;s to get to the right line, and then a bunch of b&#8217;s or w&#8217;s to get to the spot in that line that I want to edit.</p>

<p>I know how to use Ff - but they didn&#8217;t seem that great of an option.  That&#8217;s why I switched to EasyMotion and remapped (this may be considered sacrilege) my f and F to easymotion - w and easymotion - b.  Now, I can find myself zipping around in a file.  It&#8217;s pretty automatic, and I&#8217;m just wondering if other vim users do the same, or do they consider that too costly of a hack.  I mean, I never used f or F until now&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched the latest and very helpful Railscast episode this morning - on <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/285-spork">Spork</a> and wound up tweaking all the projects I&#8217;m working on to incorporate some of the things I learned in that screencast.</p>

<p>I also wound up tweaking a checklist I maintain in an Evernote entry of what I do to setup a Rails project.  Of the projects I&#8217;m working on, I wind up putting them all into a similar environment and figured it would be a useful blog post.  So here it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a git repository: Git is pretty awesome.  If you don&#8217;t care who sees your app, you can stick it up on Github for free! This is a no brainer.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com">Github</a>: Cheap and easy for a team of developers</li>
<li>Roll your own: I have a <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a> slice, and put up a private git repository</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a generic .gitignore file for the app.  Here&#8217;s what I start with (on MacOS):

<ul>
<li>.bundle</li>
<li>db/*.sqlite3</li>
<li>log/*.log</li>
<li>tmp/restart.txt</li>
<li>tmp/*</li>
<li>.DS_Store</li>
<li>public/system/documents*</li>
<li>.sass-cache/*</li>
<li>.powenv # I use <a href="http://pow.cx/">pow</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use RVM: <a href="http://beginrescueend.com">RVM</a> helps you manage multiple version of Rubies and related gem environments.  I try to use one rvm for all my &#8220;rails 3.1 apps that could end up on heroku&#8221; and call it <code>rails31</code>

<ul>
<li>Add a .rvmrc file to the root directory:  You should do this before you run <code>rails new</code> because you want to make sure you&#8217;re using the version of ruby rails you want.  This means you should have a ruby and gemset created  already via rvm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create the app: <code>rails new &lt;app_name&gt;</code> (I create so few apps, I always have to look this up - although now that I just wrote it in a blog entry, I&#8217;ll probably never have to do it again.)</li>
<li>Add the gems you want to work with.  I&#8217;ve always add a few to support BDD/TDD.

<ul>
<li>pg: Postgres is the default database on heroku, where most of my apps end up.  On top of that, I like the pg admin tool on mac os. Much more pleasant that mysql or using sqlite.</li>
<li>metric_fu: Based on advice from the Railscast <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/252-metrics-metrics-metrics">Metrics, Metrics, Metrics</a>.  Simplecov is great.</li>
<li>formtastic: great for form processing</li>
<li>rspec-rails: I like RSpec over TestUnit</li>
<li>cucumber-rails: I also like BDD - even though it can be expensive in terms of time to run a test suite.</li>
<li>capybara</li>
<li>nokogiri: helpful with cucumber and capybara</li>
<li>factory_girl_rails: test factories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add gems for continous testing:  Rails 3.1 takes a few seconds to load - and I&#8217;d rather adopt tools that make it easy to re-run tests without delays:

<ul>
<li>database-cleaner: help with speeding up test runs</li>
<li>spork: a distributed ruby server environment</li>
<li>guard: supports continuous testing</li>
<li>guard-spork: helps to configure guard and spork</li>
<li>guard-rspec: helps to configure guard and rspec (don&#8217;t forget the cli options :all_on_start => false)</li>
<li>guard-cucumber: helps to configure guard and cucumber
rb-fsevent - a listener for guard</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did you Check in yet?  Check in early and often</li>
<li>Change your spec_helper.rb file and move functionality up into the Spork pre fork block.</li>
<li>Change your environment.rb to allow for factory girl and cucumber integration (of lots of borrowable step definitions)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just wrapped up a project (well, the first phase of a project) using <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3">Microsoft&#8217;s MVC3</a> framework for a client here in Seattle.  Similar to other clients I&#8217;ve worked with, they&#8217;re a Microsoft shop and have an existing investment in the MS stack for building applications.  They wanted to leverage that investment on this project.</p>

<p>Working with MVC3 was pretty cool in that I had a differnt perspective of using Rails(Ruby) and Django/AppEngine(Python).  So, now I have perspective on using MS MVC3 I figure I&#8217;d share it with you.  Feel free to comment.</p>

<p>First - some things I liked about using MS MVC3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Intellisense - If you&#8217;re going to use MS technology, you need to use those tools, and Visual Studio is great in its implementaiton of Intellisense.  It makes it easy to code and build your app. There&#8217;s even Intellisense in Razor - the MS MVC equivelant to erb.</li>
<li>Visual Studio Debugging - Another great way to leverage the tools to step in, add watches, and examine what&#8217;s going on in your app while the server is doing its thing.</li>
<li>The Entity Framework - I&#8217;ll admit, I used to work on that team, so I&#8217;m impartial (Don&#8217;t worry, evertying I worked on is well hidden).  I like EF and where it&#8217;s going.  If you&#8217;re staring with a DB from scratch, the EF has some nice tools integrated within Visual Studio that makes it easy to get up and running.</li>
<li>Nugets: They&#8217;re the VS way to manage things like Gems inside a project.  There&#8217;s really no equivilent to RVM/VirtualEnv as it just makes sure everything is up to date - but the Nuget management made it easy to add functionality form the MVC3/.Net ecosystem.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some things I didn&#8217;t like about MVC3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Migrations.   Wow - I&#8217;m spoiled by Rails Migrations.  They are essential when working with a team of developers.  They help make it blood simple to let any one developer catch up with database changes on their own terms.  I can&#8217;t remember how I lived without them.  Even Objective C on iOS has their Core Data Migration capabilities.  MVC3 does not.  That&#8217;s painful.</li>
<li>ViewModelClasses.  That&#8217;s right, Models, just for the views.   You already define your models, but say you want to pass a few things to a view, you should create a ViewModel Class to create strong typing of that data when you get painting those views.  Sure it makes you think about what your sending to the view, but it just feels unproductive to me.  With rails, you just create an @instance variable and you&#8217;re ready to go.  Much simpler, IMO.</li>
<li>Crashes.  Visual Studio crashes alot (this is on a mid2010 MacBookPro.)  Bootcamp and Windows7 run great, but Visual Studio just crashes from time to time.  It&#8217;s a very heavyweight stack.  Compare that to VIM, which I use for everything these days, and it&#8217;s a letdown.  It&#8217;s the price you pay for that Intellisense.  I&#8217;ll chose the VIM plugins any day.</li>
<li>The ecosystem.  Between Github and Stackoverflow, I can overcome any issue I have with a Rails app, usually in a manner of seconds.  The wealth of information at your fingertips is awesome.  The community works.  With MVC3, there&#8217;s MSDN forums, but I found myself using Stackoverflow more often that not, and when I did, it was a bit of an echo chamber.  The ability to execute within the open world of Rails just seems to move at a faster pace to me.  For example, Rails just implemented CoffeeScript.  With MVC3, you can, but it took some hunting, and there&#8217;s only a couple of Google links that get you to the Web Workbench tools.  Or Testing.  Sure there&#8217;s NUnit and Microsoft Test, but I kind of like RSpec&#8217;s matching language, and all the BDD/TDD goodness you can get from using RSpec and Cucumber together.  It just seems like tools can get introduced, get developed and mature faster in the open source world.</li>
</ul>


<p>On that last point, I was talking about this with my client today.  The &#8220;open&#8221; world is just getting faster and better and I don&#8217;t see how MS can keep pace unless they change the way they do things.  Add to that the cost savings (bring your best  TCO argument) of the non-MS environment, and I know what I&#8217;d choose, I&#8217;m just happy their&#8217;s a choice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, now this is geeky, but I needed to share it.  Take your iPad and add a VNC client (I added Remoter, which is 99 cents of bugginess).  Now use your iPad with a BT keyboard and connect the VNC client to a Mac Lion machine - or VM.  Start up iTerm on the host and VIM away&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="/images/vnc-vim.png" alt="Vim over VNC" /></p>

<p>This image may look a little ugly, but Remoter doesn&#8217;t seem to hang on to my keyboard unless I have the onscreen keyboard up.  Luckily, you can just alpha it away&#8230;</p>

<p>I wanted to see how snappy this would be using an iPad over my iPhone Personal Hotspot sharing&#8230; and it&#8217;s kind of nice!  Now I need a stand for the iPad.</p>

<p>I also need to stay within VIM or iTerm2 when doing git checkins.  I haven&#8217;t really tried fugitive.vim, because gitx is so nice.  I think I&#8217;ll have to give it a shot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, this is what I need - Well, this is what I wanted before I started out thinking I should build a Schedule gem:</p>

<iframe src='http://maptini.com/maps/06f9e830-b375-012e-3f0a-12313d0361e4?embedded=true&zoom=0.4524886877828054' height='549.0196078431372' width='800' style='border:solid 2px silver;'></iframe>


<p>The problem is, I really haven&#8217;t found any schedule gems that I like.</p>

<p>What I want, is to be able to create a schedule, in a manner very similar to the API shown on the ice_cube gem - but with more than just an API, as I want something that&#8217;s easy to show on a Rails (or Formtastic) form.  So, why not build a new one&#8230; That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at right now.  I&#8217;ll let you know where it goes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just started reading Eric Ries&#8217; new book <em>The Lean Startup</em>.<br/>
Almost right away, there&#8217;s a section on the five principles of the Lean Startup.  Number 5 jumps out at me:</p>

<p>Number 5 - <strong>Innovation Accounting</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>To improve entrepreneurial outcomes and hold innovators accountable, we need to focus on the boring stuff:  how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work.  This requires a new kind of accounting designed for startups-and the people who hold them accountable.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, that&#8217;s kind of exciting to me.  Here I&#8217;ve got this accounting system that I wrote and use for myself.  While I use it for financial accounting for small businesses (HOAs) I want to take it to another level - and help startups with it.  But as this principle notes, they need <em>more</em> than pretty invoices and automated billing, they need innovation accounting.  Sure he may call it boring, but to capture and measure that data - is right up the alley of the kinds of apps I create.  I&#8217;m kind of giddy after reading this, as I can see the synergy here.</p>

<p>Taken to another level, here in Seattle, I know Jim Benson and David Anderson - two pioneers in using lean methodologies for software development.  Why can&#8217;t I get guidance from them on creating the cool kinds of metrics and integrate that stuff together.  I think there&#8217;s more than a germ of an idea here, and I just the petri dish to incubate it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like Jekyll for a static website - which this (or any blog site I write(or <em>fail</em> to write)) is.  And I really like working with the Solarized theme in VIM.  In fact, while googleing for a Solarized jekyll them, I stumbled across Octopress and am now trying it out&#8230;</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll stay with Octopress - I&#8217;m not convinced of the value and freedom of what you already get in a jekyll site.  But I have to admit, it is easier, and it&#8217;s evolving, so I imagine you can get alot for free.  And Solarized is pretty to look at.  For now, I should just blog with something to say&#8230; Like how to use jekyll, Octopress and Heroku together.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s what this post is about:</p>

<h2>Pushing to Heroku</h2>

<p>In order to push my site to Heroku, I created a Heroku app, added that Heroku information to git, and then changed the <code>.gitignore</code> file to not exclude the <code>public</code> folder.  That was really it.  The problem with this is - I&#8217;ll be churning a bunch of files each time I generate the content using Jekyll&#8230; A better way to do this would be to edit the .gitignore for this branch, and then customize the rake task to build the static content and push to Heroku.  Right now, I&#8217;m doing that manually, but I like to see what changes I&#8217;m committing so, we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<h2>Gotchas with Octopress</h2>

<p>My gotchas, anyway:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>new_post</code> Rake command.  There&#8217;s no space in there&#8230; <code>rake new_post["post_name"]</code> not <code>rake new_post ["post name"]</code>.  I got stung by that&#8230;</li>
<li>Using the <code>backtick</code> method for code - means that all the code needs to be indented.  Just different from some other tools I was using&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<h2>Theming</h2>

<p>This was one of the main reasons I wanted to use Octopress.  Here&#8217;s what I fumbled through:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s pretty easy - although I haven&#8217;t done much other than override fonts, some existing template stuff and colors.  I&#8217;ll look to do more extensive theme changes using the custom options in Octopress - more drastic css changes.  That will be next on the list&#8230;</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really should set <code>published: false</code> for some of these posts&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;But since I&#8217;m here, I now see the value in using Markdown - especially in an editor like VIM.  I&#8217;ve also loaded some helper mappings for using the spell checker when I write. It&#8217;s pretty fast! I think finding a spell checker was my last big hangup for using VIM.</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m now a convert.</p>

<p>Since getting this environment setup was so easy on my macs - I got out an old netbook with Ubuntu intalled, and I&#8217;ve pretty much got the same enironment working there!  Not that I&#8217;ll ever use it, but it&#8217;s pretty easy.  It makes me think there should be an easy way to do all of this over ssh to a desktop, from an iPad.</p>
