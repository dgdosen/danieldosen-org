I really need to find out how to "unpublish" these posts...

...But since I'm here, I now see the value in using Markdown - especially in an editor like VIM.  I've also loaded some helper mappings for using the spell checker when I write. It's pretty fast! I think finding a spell checker was my last big hangup for using VIM. 

I'm now a convert.

Shiite! Must get to the dog park.
