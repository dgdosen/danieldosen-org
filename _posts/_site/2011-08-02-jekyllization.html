<p>I&#8217;ve been reading about Jekyll (on github) and it looks like a much more desirable way to host a website and related blog than wordpress.  And for the most part &#8211; it&#8217;s written in Ruby and supports MarsEdit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so easy &#8211; it looks like stealing candy from a  baby! &#8211; What a lark, let&#8217;s try!</p>
<p>This post is going to my wordpress blog, let&#8217;s see how long it takes me to move it to Jekyll on github (not including <span class="caps">DNS</span> changes).</p>
<p>See you on the flip side.</p>
