I've been reading about Jekyll (a static web server, as noted on github) and it looks like a much more desirable way to host a website and related blog than wordpress.  For the most part - it's written in Ruby and easily works with VIM on any platform (just for kicks, I loaded VIM onto my Ubunto netbook) That means I can kick Mars Edit to the curb - because, let's face it, that software is trying to be too much to too many people, and it doesn't do the things I want to do - like highlighting syntax in entries.

It's so easy - it looks like stealing candy from a  baby! - What a lark, let's try!  I may want to pick up a bit more knowledge on Markdown (it's pretty thin) and make sure this Ubuntu machine can edit the blog...

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>class Tumbler
end</code>
  </pre>
</div>


This post is going to my wordpress blog, let's see how long it takes me to move it to Jekyll on github (not including DNS changes).

See you on the flip side.
