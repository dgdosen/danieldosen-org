So, this is what I need - Well, this is what I wanted before I started out thinking I should build a Schedule gem:

<iframe src='http://maptini.com/maps/06f9e830-b375-012e-3f0a-12313d0361e4?embedded=true&zoom=0.4524886877828054' height='549.0196078431372' width='800' style='border:solid 2px silver;'></iframe>

The problem is, I really haven't found any schedule gems that I like.

What I want, is to be able to create a schedule, in a manner very similar to the API shown on the ice\_cube gem - but with more than just an API, as I want something that's easy to show on a Rails (or Formtastic) form.  So, why not build a new one... That's where I'm at right now.  I'll let you know where it goes.
